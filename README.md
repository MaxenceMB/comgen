# 📝 ComGen
ComGen is an online function header's comment generator.   
This simple project is made in JavaScript, with of course some HTML and CSS to make it available on internet.   

## 🛠️ What does it do ?
ComGen will generate a pretty commented section that you simply have to paste in your code.   
Based on the infos you've told it, it will make a personalized yet serious header for your functions or even files. 
The goal is to have formatted headers in your files to have a prettier and more readable code.   

## 🪛 How does it work ?
You give the necessary to make it useful :    
- The name of the function and a description
- Its different arguments (type, name and description for each)
- If there is one, the returned value (type and description)

You click on "Generate" and its done !    
**Your perfect function header is here !**

## 🦚 Can I change it's looking ?
The website gives you plenty of options to personalize your header, such as :   
- The length (in characters) of the header
- The character used to fill the borders (can be blank)
- "Rounded" corners or no
- Spaces or no

And many more !


## 🗓️ In the future
I would like to add functionnalities in the future.   
The first one is the most obvious : **support for other languages**. 
For now it works for languages that supports `/*  */` to write multiline comments.   
An option to choose between languages (I think about Python for example that doesn't use same comments character) would be very useful.    
     
I would also add more personalization options like choose between single line and multi-line comments, add arguments between parentheses near the name...
